This is a header-only C++ small template library. 
It contains three main classes. An Array class and a Matrix class; both of them inherits
from AbstractArray (an abstract class).
Some of the functions make use of the mkl intel library.
To test the library, besides the mkl, you will need a C++14
compiler.

I use this library mainly to try new things and for fun.

The classes have their own iterators and support the range-based for
loop syntax.
